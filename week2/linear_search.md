# Linear Search

Basic idea: iterate across the array, left to right, searching for a specified element.

In pseudocode:

* Repeat, starting at the 1st element:
  * If this element is what you're looking for, stop.
  * Otherwise, move to the next element.

Worst-case scenario: the target element is either the last element in the array or not in the array. Computational complexity = O(n)

Best-case scenario: the target element is the 1st element in the array. Î©(1)
