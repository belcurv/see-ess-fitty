# Operators

#### Assignment

`=` - assignment. Value on the right of the `=` is assigned to the variable on the left.

#### Arithmetic

Just like JS:

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

Shorthand is the same too:

```C
x *= 5;
```

Increment and decrement shorthand is the same as well:

```C
x++;
x--;
```

#### Boolean Expressions

Evaluation to either `true` or `false`.
